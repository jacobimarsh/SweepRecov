# Sweep recovery

Interactive plot of nucleotide diversity observed for 100 bp bins in a strictly neutral region as a function of distance from a single moderately strong beneficial mutation (2Ns=100) reaching fixation from simulations with different scaling factors. Read the preprint to find out more about rescaling and best practices!
